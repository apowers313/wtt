        title: 'Understanding Merge Conflicts',
        content: `
${chalk.bold('ü§î What are merge conflicts?')}

Merge conflicts happen when two branches change the same code differently.
Git can't automatically decide which change to keep, so it asks you to choose.

${chalk.bold('Why do they happen?')}
‚Ä¢ Two people edited the same line of code
‚Ä¢ One person deleted a file, another modified it
‚Ä¢ Formatting changes conflict with code changes

${chalk.bold('Common solutions:')}
1. Pick one version (yours or theirs)
2. Combine both changes
3. Write something new that incorporates both ideas

${chalk.bold('Prevention tips:')}
‚Ä¢ Sync with main branch regularly (daily is good)
‚Ä¢ Communicate with team about who's working on what
‚Ä¢ Keep changes small and focused
‚Ä¢ Use consistent formatting rules`,
        relatedCommands: ['wt conflicts fix', 'wt merge --check', 'wt conflicts predict']
      },
      
      'lost-work': {
        title: 'Recovering Lost Work',
        content: `
${chalk.bold('üîç Don\'t panic - Git rarely loses work!')}

Git keeps a history of everything for at least 30 days, even if you think it's gone.

${chalk.bold('Where to look for lost work:')}
1. ${chalk.cyan('Git reflog')} - Shows all recent actions
2. ${chalk.cyan('Stashes')} - Temporary work storage
3. ${chalk.cyan('Automatic backups')} - Created before risky operations
4. ${chalk.cyan('Other branches')} - Work might be on a different branch

${chalk.bold('Recovery steps:')}
1. Run 'wt recovery find-commits' to see recent work
2. Look for your commit by message or date
3. Use 'wt recovery restore <commit>' to get it back

${chalk.bold('Prevention:')}
‚Ä¢ Commit often (even small changes)
‚Ä¢ Use descriptive commit messages
‚Ä¢ Push to remote regularly`,
        relatedCommands: ['wt recovery find-commits', 'wt recovery restore', 'wt backup list']
      },
      
      'conflict-resolution': {
        title: 'Step-by-Step Conflict Resolution',
        content: `
${chalk.bold('üìù Resolving conflicts step by step:')}

${chalk.cyan('1. Understand the conflict')}
   Look at both versions and understand what each is trying to do

${chalk.cyan('2. Decide on a strategy')}
   ‚Ä¢ Keep one version if it's clearly better
   ‚Ä¢ Combine both if they do different things
   ‚Ä¢ Write new code if neither is quite right

${chalk.cyan('3. Test your resolution')}
   After resolving, make sure the code still works

${chalk.cyan('4. Stage and continue')}
   Mark the file as resolved and continue the merge

${chalk.bold('Pro tips:')}
‚Ä¢ Take your time - rushing leads to bugs
‚Ä¢ Ask the other developer if unsure
‚Ä¢ Use 'wt conflicts fix --tool=vscode' for visual editing
‚Ä¢ Create a backup first with 'wt backup create'`,
        relatedCommands: ['wt conflicts fix', 'wt conflicts list', 'wt backup create']
      },
      
      'merge-strategy': {
        title: 'Choosing a Merge Strategy',
        content: `
${chalk.bold('üéØ Different ways to merge:')}

${chalk.cyan('Regular merge (default)')}
‚Ä¢ Preserves all commit history
‚Ä¢ Shows who did what and when
‚Ä¢ Best for: feature branches, team collaboration

${chalk.cyan('Squash merge')}
‚Ä¢ Combines all commits into one
‚Ä¢ Cleaner history
‚Ä¢ Best for: small fixes, experiments

${chalk.cyan('Rebase')}
‚Ä¢ Moves your commits on top of target branch
‚Ä¢ Linear history
‚Ä¢ Best for: personal branches (never rebase shared branches!)

${chalk.bold('Which to choose?')}
‚Ä¢ Use regular merge for most cases
‚Ä¢ Use squash for tiny changes
‚Ä¢ Only rebase if you know what you're doing`,
        relatedCommands: ['wt merge', 'git merge --squash', 'git rebase']
      },
      
      'backup-restore': {
        title: 'Using Backups',
        content: `
${chalk.bold('üîí Automatic backup system:')}

wtt automatically creates backups before risky operations like merges.

${chalk.bold('What gets backed up?')}
‚Ä¢ Current branch state
‚Ä¢ All uncommitted changes
‚Ä¢ Stashes
‚Ä¢ Branch references

${chalk.bold('Using backups:')}
${chalk.cyan('List backups:')} wt backup list
${chalk.cyan('Restore:')} wt backup restore <backup-id>
${chalk.cyan('Clean old:')} wt backup clean --older-than 7d

${chalk.bold('Manual backups:')}
Create your own backup anytime:
  wt backup create "Before big refactor"`,
        relatedCommands: ['wt backup list', 'wt backup restore', 'wt backup create']
      }
    };
