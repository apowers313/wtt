# Test Coverage Progress Report

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
1. **Installed @inquirer/testing** - Though we didn't need it for create.js since it doesn't use prompts directly
2. **Created mock helper utilities** (`test/setup/mockHelpers.js`)
   - Reusable mock factories for all major dependencies
   - Consistent mock behavior across tests

### ✅ create.js Command Tests (100% Coverage)
Successfully implemented 12 comprehensive unit tests:
- Basic worktree creation with port assignment
- Creating from specific base branch
- Error handling for existing worktrees
- Error handling for non-existent base branches
- Gitignore file management (create/update)
- Graceful error recovery
- Usage instruction display
- All error scenarios (validation, port assignment, disk errors)

**Coverage Impact:**
- create.js: 0% → 100% statements (97 lines covered)
- Overall: 0% → 12.51% statements

## Key Learnings

1. **Mock simple-git early** - Must mock before any imports to prevent initialization
2. **Handle process.exit** - Wrap error tests in try-catch blocks
3. **Test isolation** - Clear all mocks between tests to prevent interference
4. **Exact string matching** - Pay attention to whitespace in file content assertions

## Next Steps

Following the test coverage plan, the priority order is:
1. **remove.js** (152 lines) - In progress
2. **merge.js** (112 lines)
3. **Complete library coverage** (gitOps.js, portManager.js)
4. **Remaining commands** (list.js, ports.js, switch.js)

## Coverage Trajectory

At current pace, adding tests for all commands will bring coverage to ~70%.
Adding library tests will reach the 90% target.
