# Test Suite Analysis

## Summary
- Total Tests: 89
- Passing: 21
- Failing: 68

## Categories of Failures

### 1. Unit Tests - Tests Need Fixing (100% test issues)
The unit tests were written against a different API than what was implemented:

- **gitOps.test.js**: 
  - Tests non-existent `isGitRepo()` method
  - Incorrect mocking approach (mocks return value but code creates new git instance)
  - `hasUncommittedChanges()` requires a path parameter

- **portManager.test.js**:
  - Tests expect different method signatures
  - `assignPorts()` takes (worktreeName, services, portRanges) not (worktreeName, config)

- **config.test.js**:
  - Tests expect the module to be a singleton, but it's a class instance

### 2. Integration/E2E Tests - Mixed Issues

#### Tests that need fixing (wrong expectations):
- **create.test.js**: Expects "Created worktree" but actual output is "âœ“ Worktree created"
- **list.test.js**: Expects pattern filtering which isn't implemented
- **merge.test.js**: Uses worktree names instead of branch names
- **remove.test.js**: Uses worktree names instead of branch names  
- **switch.test.js**: Expects partial name matching not implemented
- **ports.test.js**: Expects ports to exist without creating worktrees first

#### Potential Implementation Issues:
- **list command**: Doesn't support pattern filtering as tests expect
- **switch command**: Doesn't support partial name matching
- **merge/remove commands**: Confusion between worktree names and branch names

### 3. Working Tests
- **simple-integration.test.js**: All 3 tests pass
- **working-tests.test.js**: All 6 tests pass

## Recommendations

### Fix Tests First:
1. Update unit tests to match actual implementation API
2. Fix integration test expectations to match actual command output
3. Use worktree names (wt-*) consistently in tests

### Consider Implementation Enhancements:
1. Add pattern filtering to `list` command
2. Add partial name matching to `switch` command  
3. Make commands accept both branch names and worktree names for convenience

### Test Strategy:
- Use `working-tests.test.js` as the reference for correct test patterns
- Focus on integration tests over unit tests since this is a CLI tool
- Test actual command behavior rather than internal implementation details
