# Merge Helper Design Document

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive approach to making git merging easier to understand and resolve for users of the Git Worktree Tool (wtt). It identifies common merge problems, their causes, and provides simple explanations and solutions in lay terms.

## Goals

1. Identify and prevent merge problems before they occur
2. Provide clear, jargon-free explanations when problems arise
3. Offer step-by-step solutions that non-experts can follow
4. Automate common fixes where possible
5. Build user confidence in handling merges

## Common Merge Problems and Solutions

**Note on Resolution Options**: For each merge problem, we present multiple resolution options when available. Options are typically ordered from safest/most recommended to more advanced/risky. Users should choose based on their comfort level and specific situation.

### 1. Uncommitted Changes Blocking Merge

**What happens:**
User tries to merge but gets: "Your local changes would be overwritten by merge"

**Simple explanation:**
"You have changes that haven't been committed yet. These changes would be lost if we merge now."

**Resolution options:**
```
Option A: Save changes temporarily (recommended)
1. Save your current work:
   wtt save-work
   (This runs: git stash save "Work in progress before merge")

2. Try the merge again:
   wtt merge <branch>

3. Get your work back:
   wtt restore-work
   (This runs: git stash pop)

Option B: Commit your changes first
1. Commit your work:
   wtt commit -m "Work in progress"

2. Proceed with merge:
   wtt merge <branch>

Option C: Discard your changes (careful!)
1. Reset to clean state:
   wtt reset --hard
   ⚠️  This permanently deletes uncommitted changes

2. Proceed with merge:
   wtt merge <branch>
```

### 2. Same Line Changed Differently

**What happens:**
Both branches changed the same line of code

**Simple explanation:**
"Both branches changed the same line of code. Git needs you to choose which version to keep."

**Resolution options:**
```
We'll show you both versions:
   
   Your version:
   └─ const timeout = 5000;
   
   Their version:
   └─ const timeout = 3000;

Option A: Keep one version
   a) Keep your version (5000)
   b) Keep their version (3000)

Option B: Merge both changes
   c) Use a different value: ____
   d) Keep both temporarily (requires manual cleanup)

Option C: View more context
   e) Show surrounding code
   f) Show file history
   g) Compare with base version
```

### 3. File Deleted vs Modified

**What happens:**
One branch deleted a file, the other modified it

**Simple explanation:**
"One branch deleted this file while another branch modified it. You need to decide whether to keep or delete the file."

**Resolution options:**
```
What happened:
   - Branch A: Deleted config.js (reason: "No longer needed")
   - Branch B: Modified config.js (added new settings)

Option A: Keep the file
   wtt keep-file config.js
   (Preserves the file with all modifications)

Option B: Delete the file
   wtt remove-file config.js
   (Confirms the deletion was intentional)

Option C: Move content elsewhere
   1. Extract the modifications:
      wtt show-changes config.js
   
   2. Apply to different file:
      wtt apply-to newconfig.js
   
   3. Confirm deletion of original:
      wtt remove-file config.js

Option D: Investigate further
   wtt history config.js
   (Shows why file was deleted and what was added)
```

### 4. Merge Conflicts in Multiple Files

**What happens:**
Several files have conflicts

**Simple explanation:**
"Several files have conflicts. We'll resolve them one at a time."

**Resolution options:**
```
See all conflicts:
   wtt conflicts list
   
   📄 src/app.js (2 conflicts)
   📄 src/config.js (1 conflict)
   📄 tests/app.test.js (1 conflict)

Option A: Interactive resolution (recommended)
   wtt conflicts fix --interactive
   (Guides you through each conflict)

Option B: Fix one at a time
   wtt conflicts fix src/app.js
   wtt conflicts fix src/config.js
   wtt conflicts fix tests/app.test.js

Option C: Use external merge tool
   wtt conflicts fix --tool=vscode
   (Opens in your configured merge tool)

Option D: Accept all from one side (careful!)
   wtt conflicts accept --theirs  # Accept all their changes
   wtt conflicts accept --ours    # Accept all your changes
   ⚠️  Review changes carefully before committing
```

### 5. Diverged Branches (Behind and Ahead)

**What happens:**
Local and remote branches have different commits

**Simple explanation:**
"Your branch and the remote branch have different commits. We need to combine them."

**Resolution options:**
```
Option A: Merge (preserves all commit history)
1. Pull and merge remote changes:
   wtt pull --merge

2. Resolve any conflicts that arise

3. Push the merged result:
   wtt push

Option B: Rebase (creates linear history)
1. Rebase your changes on top:
   wtt pull --rebase

2. Resolve conflicts for each commit

3. Push with force (if needed):
   wtt push --force-with-lease
   ⚠️  Only use on personal branches

Option C: Create a new branch
1. Save current work to new branch:
   wtt branch save-current

2. Reset to match remote:
   wtt reset --hard origin/<branch>

3. Cherry-pick your changes:
   wtt cherry-pick save-current
```

### 6. Lost Work After Merge

**What happens:**
User's changes seem to disappear after merge

**Simple explanation:**
"Your changes aren't lost. Git keeps a history of all commits, and we can recover them."

**Resolution options:**
```
Option A: Use recovery tool
1. Find your lost work:
   wtt recovery find-commits
   
   Recent work found:
   🕐 2 hours ago: "Added user authentication"
   🕑 3 hours ago: "Fixed login bug"

2. Restore specific changes:
   wtt recovery restore "Added user authentication"

Option B: Use git reflog directly
1. View all recent operations:
   wtt reflog

2. Find and restore your commit:
   wtt restore <commit-id>

Option C: Check if changes are stashed
1. List all stashes:
   wtt stash list

2. Apply relevant stash:
   wtt stash apply stash@{0}
```

### 7. Whitespace/Formatting Conflicts

**What happens:**
Conflicts due to spaces, tabs, or line endings

**Simple explanation:**
"The code is the same, but the spacing or line endings are different."

**Resolution options:**
```
Option A: Ignore whitespace during merge
1. Merge ignoring whitespace:
   wtt merge --ignore-whitespace

Option B: Fix formatting before merge
1. Apply consistent formatting:
   wtt format --all

2. Commit formatting changes:
   wtt commit -m "Standardize formatting"

3. Retry merge:
   wtt merge <branch>

Option C: Set permanent formatting rules
1. Set team standards:
   wtt init --formatting
   (Creates .editorconfig and .gitattributes)

2. Apply to all files:
   wtt format --apply-standards

3. Commit and merge:
   wtt commit -m "Apply formatting standards"
   wtt merge <branch>
```

### 8. Binary File Conflicts

**What happens:**
Conflicts in images, PDFs, or other non-text files

**Simple explanation:**
"Both branches have different versions of this binary file. You need to choose which version to keep."

**Resolution options:**
```
Binary file conflict detected:
   📷 logo.png (Your version) - 45KB, updated today
   📷 logo.png (Their version) - 52KB, updated yesterday

Option A: Choose one version
   wtt binary keep --ours logo.png    # Keep your version
   wtt binary keep --theirs logo.png  # Keep their version

Option B: Keep both versions
   wtt binary keep-both logo.png
   Creates:
   - logo.png (their version)
   - logo-yours.png (your version)

Option C: Preview before deciding
   wtt binary preview logo.png
   (Opens both versions for comparison)

Option D: Use external version
   wtt binary replace logo.png --with=/path/to/new/logo.png
   (Replace with a completely different file)
```

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Pre-Merge Checks

```
wtt merge <branch> --check

Checking merge safety...
✅ No uncommitted changes
✅ Branch is up to date
⚠️  3 files will have conflicts:
   - src/app.js (2 conflicts)
   - src/config.js (1 conflict)
   - package.json (1 conflict)

Continue with merge? [y/N]
```

### 2. Regular Sync Reminders

```
wtt status

⚠️  Your branch is 15 commits behind main (last synced 5 days ago)
💡 Run 'wtt sync' to update your branch and avoid future conflicts
```

### 3. Conflict Prediction

```
wtt conflicts predict

Analyzing code overlap with main branch...

⚠️  High conflict risk in:
   - src/auth.js (3 team members editing)
   - src/database.js (major refactor in progress)

💡 Consider:
   - Syncing now before more conflicts accumulate
   - Coordinating with team on src/auth.js changes
```

## User Interface Design

### 1. Conflict Resolution Interface

```
CONFLICT in src/app.js

The same code was changed in two different ways:

┌─── YOUR VERSION ─────────────────┐
│ function calculate(x, y) {       │
│   return x + y + 10;            │
│ }                               │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

┌─── TEAM'S VERSION ──────────────┐
│ function calculate(x, y, z) {    │
│   return x + y + z;             │
│ }                               │
└─────────────────────────────────┘

What would you like to do?
1) Keep your version
2) Keep team's version
3) Write a new version
4) Keep both (will need manual cleanup)
5) See more context
6) Ask for help

Choice [1-6]:
```

### 2. Progress Tracking

```
Merge Progress: Authentication Feature → Main

Step 1/4: Preparing merge           ✅
Step 2/4: Detecting conflicts       ✅
Step 3/4: Resolving conflicts       🔄

Files resolved: 2/5
├─ ✅ package.json
├─ ✅ src/index.js
├─ 🔄 src/auth.js (working on this)
├─ ⏳ src/database.js
└─ ⏳ tests/auth.test.js

[=====>          ] 40% complete
```

### 3. Help System

```
wtt help merge-conflicts

🤔 Merge conflicts happen when two branches change the same code differently.

Git can't automatically decide which change to keep, so it asks you to choose.

Common solutions:
1. Pick one version
2. Combine both changes
3. Write something new

Need more help? Try:
- wtt guide merge-conflicts (interactive tutorial)
- wtt merge --practice (safe practice mode)
```

## Error Recovery

### 1. Panic Button

```
wtt panic

Let's fix this step by step.

What went wrong?
1) Merge has conflicts I don't understand
2) I think I lost some work
3) Everything looks broken
4) I want to start over
5) Something else

Choice [1-5]:
```

### 2. Safe Abort

```
wtt merge --abort

Canceling merge...
✅ Merge cancelled
✅ Your work is safe
✅ Branch returned to pre-merge state

Your uncommitted changes are saved in:
📁 .worktrees/.merge-backup-2024-01-20-143022

To restore later: wtt restore-backup
```

### 3. Automatic Backups

```
Before risky operations:

🔒 Creating safety backup...
   - Current branch state saved
   - Uncommitted changes preserved
   - Recovery point created

If something goes wrong:
   wtt restore --last-backup
```

## Integration with Worktree Tool

### 1. Worktree-Specific Merge

```
wtt merge feature-auth

Merging 'feature-auth' worktree into current branch...

Worktree details:
📁 Location: .worktrees/wt-feature-auth
🔧 Port assignments will be updated
📝 CLAUDE.md will be merged
```

### 2. Cross-Worktree Conflict Detection

```
wtt conflicts check --all-worktrees

Checking for conflicts across all worktrees...

⚠️  Potential conflicts detected:
   
   wt-feature-auth ↔ wt-feature-ui
   └─ Both modify: src/components/Button.js
   
   wt-bugfix-login ↔ main
   └─ Both modify: src/auth.js

💡 Consider merging wt-bugfix-login first to reduce conflicts
```

## Learning Mode

### 1. Practice Merges

```
wtt learn merge

Welcome to Merge Practice! 🎓

We'll create a safe practice environment where you can:
- Try different merge scenarios
- Practice resolving conflicts
- Learn without fear of breaking anything

Start with:
1) Simple merge (no conflicts)
2) Single file conflict
3) Multiple file conflicts
4) Complex scenarios

Choice [1-4]:
```

### 2. Explanations During Operations

```
wtt merge main --explain

📚 Here's what's happening:

1. First, we'll get the latest changes from 'main'
   (Making sure we have all team updates)

2. Then, we'll try to combine your changes with main
   (Git will automatically merge what it can)

3. If there are conflicts, we'll resolve them together
   (You decide which changes to keep)

Ready to proceed? [y/N]
```

## Success Metrics

1. **Reduced merge anxiety**: Users feel confident attempting merges
2. **Faster conflict resolution**: Average resolution time decreased
3. **Fewer abandoned merges**: Users complete merges instead of giving up
4. **Learning progress**: Users graduate from guided to independent merging
5. **Prevented conflicts**: Proactive syncing reduces conflict frequency

```

### Core Module Specifications

#### 1. Enhanced Merge Command (`src/commands/merge.js`)

**Purpose**: Replace basic git merge with intelligent, user-friendly merge process

**Key Features**:
- Pre-merge safety checks
- Automatic conflict detection
- Human-friendly error messages
- Multiple resolution options

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Command structure
async function merge(branch, options = {}) {
  // Phase 1: Pre-merge validation
  const validation = await validateMerge(branch, options);
  if (!validation.safe) {
    return handlePreMergeIssues(validation.issues);
  }

  // Phase 2: Conflict prediction
  const conflicts = await predictConflicts(branch);
  if (conflicts.length > 0 && !options.force) {
    return showConflictPreview(conflicts);
  }

  // Phase 3: Execute merge with monitoring
  return await executeMonitoredMerge(branch, options);
}
```

**Error Message Templates**:
```javascript
const MERGE_MESSAGES = {
  uncommittedChanges: {
    title: "You have unsaved changes",
    explanation: "These changes would be lost if we merge now.",
    options: [
      {
        label: "Save changes temporarily (recommended)",
        command: "wtt save-work",
        safe: true,
        skill: "beginner"
      },
      {
        label: "Commit your changes first",
        command: "wtt commit -m 'Work in progress'",
        safe: true,
        skill: "intermediate"
      },
      {
        label: "Discard your changes (careful!)",
        command: "wtt reset --hard",
        safe: false,
        skill: "advanced",
        warning: "This permanently deletes uncommitted changes"
      }
    ]
  },
  // ... other message templates
};
```

#### 2. Conflict Resolution System (`src/lib/merge-helper/conflict-resolver.js`)

**Purpose**: Provide interactive, guided conflict resolution

**Key Features**:
- Visual diff display
- Multiple resolution strategies
- Context-aware suggestions
- Progress tracking

**Implementation**:
```javascript
class ConflictResolver {
  async resolveConflicts(conflictedFiles) {
    const progress = new ProgressTracker(conflictedFiles.length);
    
    for (const file of conflictedFiles) {
      const conflicts = await this.analyzeFileConflicts(file);
      
      for (const conflict of conflicts) {
        const resolution = await this.presentConflictOptions(conflict);
        await this.applyResolution(conflict, resolution);
        progress.update();
      }
    }
    
    return progress.complete();
  }

  async presentConflictOptions(conflict) {
    const ui = new ConflictUI();
    
    // Show visual diff
    ui.showConflict({
      file: conflict.file,
      lineNumber: conflict.line,
      yourVersion: conflict.ours,
      theirVersion: conflict.theirs,
      context: conflict.context
    });
    
    // Present resolution options
    const options = this.generateResolutionOptions(conflict);
    return await ui.promptForChoice(options);
  }
}
```

#### 3. Message Formatter (`src/lib/merge-helper/message-formatter.js`)

**Purpose**: Convert technical git errors into human-friendly explanations

**Key Features**:
- Pattern matching for common git errors
- Contextual explanations
- Suggested actions with skill level indicators

**Implementation**:
```javascript
class MessageFormatter {
  formatError(gitError, context = {}) {
    const pattern = this.identifyErrorPattern(gitError);
    const template = this.getMessageTemplate(pattern);
    
    return {
      title: template.title,
      explanation: this.contextualizeMessage(template.explanation, context),
      options: this.rankOptionsBySkillLevel(template.options, context.userSkill),
      helpAvailable: template.helpTopics || []
    };
  }

  identifyErrorPattern(error) {
    const patterns = {
      uncommittedChanges: /would be overwritten by merge/i,
      conflictMarkers: /Automatic merge failed.*fix conflicts/i,
      divergedBranches: /Your branch and.*have diverged/i,
      // ... more patterns
    };
    
    for (const [pattern, regex] of Object.entries(patterns)) {
      if (regex.test(error)) return pattern;
    }
    
    return 'unknown';
  }
}
```

#### 4. Backup Manager (`src/lib/merge-helper/backup-manager.js`)

**Purpose**: Automatic safety backups before risky operations

**Key Features**:
- Pre-operation state snapshots
- Uncommitted changes preservation
- Easy restoration commands

**Implementation**:
```javascript
class BackupManager {
  async createSafetyBackup(operation) {
    const timestamp = new Date().toISOString().replace(/[:.]/g, '-');
    const backupDir = `.worktrees/.backups/${operation}-${timestamp}`;
    
    // Create backup directory
    await fs.mkdir(backupDir, { recursive: true });
    
    // Save current state
    const backup = {
      branch: await git.getCurrentBranch(),
      commit: await git.getCurrentCommit(),
      uncommittedChanges: await this.saveUncommittedChanges(backupDir),
      stashes: await this.saveStashes(backupDir),
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      operation
    };
    
    await fs.writeFile(`${backupDir}/backup-info.json`, JSON.stringify(backup, null, 2));
    
    return backup;
  }

  async restoreFromBackup(backupId) {
    const backupDir = `.worktrees/.backups/${backupId}`;
    const backupInfo = JSON.parse(await fs.readFile(`${backupDir}/backup-info.json`));
    
    // Restore branch state
    await git.checkout(backupInfo.branch);
    await git.reset('--hard', backupInfo.commit);
    
    // Restore uncommitted changes
    if (backupInfo.uncommittedChanges) {
      await this.restoreUncommittedChanges(backupDir);
    }
    
    return backupInfo;
  }
}
```

### New Command Implementations

    await panicHandler.handleEmergency();
  });

class PanicHandler {
  async handleEmergency() {
    console.log(chalk.yellow('🚨 Emergency Mode - Let\'s fix this step by step'));
    
    const situation = await inquirer.prompt([{
      type: 'list',
      name: 'problem',
      message: 'What went wrong?',
      choices: [
        'Merge has conflicts I don\'t understand',
        'I think I lost some work',
        'Everything looks broken',
        'I want to start over',
        'Something else'
      ]
    }]);
    
    await this.handleSituation(situation.problem);
  }
}
```

### User Interface Components

#### 1. Interactive Conflict Resolution UI (`src/lib/ui/conflict-ui.js`)

```javascript
class ConflictUI {
  async showConflict(conflict) {
    console.log(chalk.red.bold(`CONFLICT in ${conflict.file}`));
    console.log('\nThe same code was changed in two different ways:\n');
    
    // Show your version
    console.log(chalk.blue('┌─── YOUR VERSION ─────────────────┐'));
    conflict.yourVersion.split('\n').forEach(line => {
      console.log(chalk.blue(`│ ${line.padEnd(31)} │`));
    });
    console.log(chalk.blue('└─────────────────────────────────┘\n'));
    
    // Show their version
    console.log(chalk.green('┌─── TEAM\'S VERSION ──────────────┐'));
    conflict.theirVersion.split('\n').forEach(line => {
      console.log(chalk.green(`│ ${line.padEnd(31)} │`));
    });
    console.log(chalk.green('└─────────────────────────────────┘\n'));
  }
  
  async promptForChoice(options) {
    const choices = options.map((opt, index) => ({
      name: `${opt.label} ${opt.safe ? '✅' : '⚠️'} (${opt.skill})`,
      value: index,
      short: opt.label
    }));
    
    const answer = await inquirer.prompt([{
      type: 'list',
      name: 'choice',
      message: 'What would you like to do?',
      choices
    }]);
    
    return options[answer.choice];
  }
}
```

#### 2. Progress Tracking UI (`src/lib/ui/progress-ui.js`)

```javascript
class ProgressTracker {

### Testing Strategy

#### 1. Unit Tests
- Test each module independently
- Mock git operations for predictable testing
- Test error message formatting with various git outputs
- Validate conflict detection algorithms

#### 2. Integration Tests
- Test complete merge workflows
- Simulate various conflict scenarios
- Test backup and recovery systems
- Verify cross-worktree functionality

#### 3. User Experience Tests
- Test with real git repositories
- Validate message clarity with non-technical users
- Measure task completion rates
- Test panic/recovery scenarios

### Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
```bash
# Deliverables:
- Enhanced merge command with pre-checks
- Basic conflict detection
- Message formatter with common error patterns
- Simple backup system
- Basic conflict resolution UI

# Files to create/modify:
- src/commands/merge.js (enhance existing)
- src/lib/merge-helper/ (new directory)
- src/templates/messages.js (new)
```

#### Phase 2: Interactive Resolution (Week 3-4)
```bash
# Deliverables:
- Interactive conflict resolver
- Progress tracking
- Multiple file conflict handling
- Recovery commands
- Help system integration

# Files to create:
- src/commands/conflicts.js
- src/commands/recovery.js
- src/lib/ui/conflict-ui.js
- src/lib/ui/progress-ui.js
```

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)
```bash
# Deliverables:
- Conflict prediction
- Panic button system
- Cross-worktree conflict detection
- Binary file conflict handling
- Learning/practice mode

# Files to create:
- src/commands/panic.js
- Enhanced conflict prediction algorithms
- Cross-worktree analysis tools
```

### Configuration and Customization

The system will support user customization through `.worktree-config.json`:

```json
{
  "mergeHelper": {
    "skillLevel": "beginner|intermediate|advanced",
    "autoBackup": true,
    "conflictStrategy": "interactive|guided|manual",
    "messageStyle": "friendly|concise|technical",
    "safetyChecks": {
      "requireCleanState": true,
      "confirmDestructiveOperations": true,
      "maxConflictsBeforeWarning": 5
    }
  }
}
```

### Success Metrics and Validation

1. **User Adoption**: Track usage of new merge helper commands vs traditional git merge
2. **Completion Rate**: Measure percentage of merges completed vs abandoned
3. **Resolution Time**: Average time to resolve conflicts (should decrease over time)
4. **Error Recovery**: Number of panic button uses and successful recoveries
5. **User Feedback**: Regular surveys on merge confidence and tool effectiveness

This implementation plan provides the detailed technical specifications needed for Claude Code to implement the merge helper functionality systematically and completely.

## Summary

This design prioritizes user understanding and confidence over technical complexity. By explaining problems in simple terms, providing clear solutions, and offering safety nets, we can transform merging from a feared operation into a routine task that users handle confidently.
