wt conflicts <worktree-name>
```
- Analyzes potential conflicts before merge
- Suggests resolution order for multiple worktrees
- Estimates merge complexity

## 7. Time Tracking & Analytics

### Feature: Worktree Time Tracking
```bash
wt time <worktree-name>
```
- Tracks time spent in each worktree
- Integrates with git commits for activity detection
- Generates time reports per feature

### Feature: Productivity Analytics
```bash
wt stats [--period 7d]
```
- Shows worktree creation/merge frequency
- Average feature development time
- Identifies bottlenecks in workflow

## 8. Advanced Git Operations

### Feature: Stacked Worktrees
```bash
wt create feature-ui-part2 --stack-on feature-ui
```
- Creates dependent worktrees for incremental features
- Manages rebase chains automatically
- Visualizes dependency graph

### Feature: Worktree Sync Groups
```bash
wt sync-group add frontend feature-ui feature-auth
wt sync-group pull frontend
```
- Groups related worktrees
- Synchronizes changes across group
- Useful for features spanning multiple branches

## 9. IDE Integration

### Feature: VS Code Workspace Generation
```bash
wt code <worktree-name>
```
- Opens VS Code with worktree-specific settings
- Configures debugger with correct ports
- Sets up workspace-specific extensions

### Feature: Terminal Multiplexer Integration
```bash
wt tmux <worktree-name>
```
- Creates tmux session with preset panes
- Each pane for different service (vite, storybook, tests)
- Saves/restores tmux layouts

## 10. Backup & Recovery

### Feature: Worktree Snapshots
```bash
wt snapshot <worktree-name>
```
- Creates backup of uncommitted changes
- Includes port assignments and environment
- Allows recovery after accidental deletion

### Feature: Disaster Recovery
```bash
wt recover --from-backup
```
- Rebuilds worktree structure from snapshots
- Restores port assignments
- Recovers uncommitted work

## 11. Performance Optimization

### Feature: Resource Limits
```bash
wt limit <worktree-name> --cpu 2 --memory 4G
```
- Sets resource limits per worktree
- Prevents runaway processes
- Useful for testing performance constraints

### Feature: Lazy Loading
```bash
wt hibernate <worktree-name>
```
- Stops all services but preserves state
- Quick resume when needed
- Reduces resource usage for inactive worktrees

## 12. Security Features

### Feature: Secret Isolation
```bash
wt secrets <worktree-name>
```
- Separate .env files per worktree
- Prevents secret leakage between features
- Automatic secret rotation warnings

### Feature: Audit Trail
```bash
wt audit [--days 30]
```

- Useful for compliance requirements

## Priority Recommendations

Based on your use case with Claude Code, I'd prioritize:

1. **Claude Context Management** - Crucial for AI-assisted development
2. **Service Orchestration** (`wt up`) - Major time saver
3. **Merge Conflict Prediction** - Prevents integration headaches
4. **VS Code Integration** - Seamless IDE experience
5. **Worktree Templates** - Standardizes common patterns

These features would make parallel development significantly smoother and more efficient.
